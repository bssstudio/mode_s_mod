This project approximates the MODE-S modulator as a research tool.


There are 2 parts of the modulator. The `gen` program generates random packets, computes CRC and does pulse position modulation. Its output are pulses at 20Msamples/s that are sent to `nc` that in turn sends them via UDP port 1234.

 ./gen | nc -u 127.0.0.1 1234

 The second part is `mode_s_mod.grc` - gnuradio companion project that receives pulses via UDP port 1234 and does the pulse shaping and writes the samples into a file (varable trace_file).
 It features adjustable pulse bandwidth.

To run, first start the grc project and adjust the bandwidth, then start the generator by running:

```
 ./gen | nc -u 127.0.0.1 1234
```


## Compilation

```
gcc -o gen gen.c
```
